    "**DDL (Data Definition Language):**\n",
    "\n",
    "DDL, or Data Definition Language, is a subset of SQL used for defining and managing the structure of a database. DDL commands are responsible for defining, altering, and dropping database objects such as tables, indexes, and views. The primary DDL commands include CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. CREATE:**\n",
    "The CREATE command is used to create a new database object, such as a table. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    first_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    last_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    hire_date DATE\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This SQL statement creates a table named \"employees\" with columns for employee ID, first name, last name, and hire date.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. DROP:**\n",
    "The DROP command is used to remove an existing database object, such as a table. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This SQL statement removes the \"employees\" table from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. ALTER:**\n",
    "The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN department_id INT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This SQL statement adds a new column, \"department_id,\" to the existing \"employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. TRUNCATE:**\n",
    "The TRUNCATE command is used to remove all rows from a table, but it retains the table structure for future use. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This SQL statement removes all records from the \"employees\" table, effectively resetting the data while keeping the table structure intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, DDL commands (CREATE, DROP, ALTER, TRUNCATE) are crucial for defining, modifying, and managing the structure of a database, allowing developers to create tables, alter their structure, remove tables, and reset data as needed."

    "The UPDATE command is used to modify existing records in a table. For example:\n",

    "UPDATE employees\n",
    "SET last_name = 'Smith'\n",
    "WHERE employee_id = 1;\n",

    "\n",
    "This SQL statement updates the \"last_name\" column in the \"employees\" table, changing the value to 'Smith' for the record where \"employee_id\" is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. DELETE:**\n",
    "The DELETE command is used to remove records from a table based on a specified condition. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE employee_id = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
